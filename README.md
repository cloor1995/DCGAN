# DCGAN

## Abstract

The goal of this work is to generate human faces. For this purpose, different datasets with different styles were used (real and drawn faces). Furthermore, different image resolution were used and the implementation was done with the help of generative models ⇒  Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

Further documentation of the implementation and the results are described in 'Präsentation-IIS-Gruppe6-DCGAN.pptx', which can be downloaded here:
