# DCGAN

## Project requirements 

Design and implement in group work (max. 3 persons) an artificial neural network (ANN) as a machine learning model for a dataset and a use case of your
of your choice. Choose a suitable architecture and train the model with the training data. Also, adjust the hyperparameters of the model
according to the results on the validation set. Evaluate your results against the test data. For this, we recommend the use of Python
3, as well as using software packages such as Tensorflow or PyTorch. At the end of the present your results to the chair and your fellow students (15 minutes per group). In doing so, briefly present your chosen dataset and use case briefly. You should also discuss the architecture of your model and the results.
Be sure to choose appropriate metrics for your results.

## Abstract

The goal of this work is to generate human faces. For this purpose, different datasets with different styles were used (real and drawn faces). Furthermore, different image resolution were used and the implementation was done with the help of generative models ⇒  Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

Further documentation of the implementation and the results are described in 'Präsentation-IIS-Gruppe6-DCGAN.pptx', which can be downloaded here:
